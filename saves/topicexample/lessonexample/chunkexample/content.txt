Functions are defined with the def statement. The statement ends with a colon, and the code that
is part of the function is indented below the def statement. Here we create a simple function that
just prints something.
def print_hello():
    print('Hello!')

print_hello()
    print('1234567')
    print_hello()
We'll work on formatting later...
