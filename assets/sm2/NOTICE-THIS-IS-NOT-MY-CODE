I do not own the code of SM2. I am not a neuroscientist, so I'm just going to use this
library for spaed repetition instead. It is the one used by Anki, and it seems to be a good algo for this.

Anki doesn't even use SM2 the way that the documentation suggests, so I'll be on my own path
making this. I don't want to copy Anki.
Example:
The SM-2 Algorithm takes 5 values for recall quality:
    5: perfect response.
    4: correct response after a hesitation.
    3: correct response recalled with serious difficulty.
    2: incorrect response; where the correct one seemed easy to recall.
    1: incorrect response; the correct one remembered.
    0: complete blackout.
However, Anki only takes:
    Again/Forgot
    Hard
    Good
    Easy
    as options.
