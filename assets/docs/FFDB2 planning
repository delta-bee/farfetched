Log Database (FFDB2) has:
id,entry_type (str),quality,easiness,review_datetime,path in that order
Downstream, the project needs to know quality, easiness, interval, repetitions, review_datetime=None
However, we can use current datetime, calculate intervals and repetitions ourselves, so we only need to get quality, easiness from the database, with the datetime of the review log to calculate a correct interval.
