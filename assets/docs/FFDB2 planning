Following the removal of FFDB1, FarFetched will now use FFDB2 for all of its persistent memory (excluding lesson files).
FFDB2 is the protocol of FarFetched's data.db file, which is implemented with SQLite.
data.db has only one table, 'logs'.

Database (FFDB2) entry types:
    In table Logs:
    Review complete declaration (entry_type = review_log)
    Note- Entry_type is a vestigial column. It's useless now.
    FORMAT: id(int), entry_type(str, just says "review_log"), quality (int), easiness(float), review_datetime(str), path(str)
    Downstream, the project needs to know quality, easiness, interval, repetitions, review_datetime=None
    However, we can use current datetime, calculate intervals and repetitions ourselves, so we only need to get quality, easiness from the database, with the datetime of the review log to calculate a correct interval.
