The database should be composed of entries in list format
['entryversion','entrytype','data1','data2','data3']
FFDB1 Protocol:
['1','reviewcomplete','boolean','questionpath','timestamp'] #Example of the first type of declaration, the review complete announcement
['2','reviewcomplete','accuracy (int)','questionpath','timestamp'] #V2 review complete declaration, modified

Upgrading FarFetched to utilize the SM2 algorithm is going to be hectic, and will require major changes to nearly ALL of my code.
As a result, we are now switching to JSON entries for the database, and since nobody actually uses FarFetched 0.1.0, I'm not going to add
support for FFDB1.
FFDB1 is no longer supported. We are using FFDB2 now, which is an actual database.
