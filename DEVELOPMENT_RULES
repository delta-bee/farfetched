This is a file containing the rules for contributions to this repo.

FarFetched Base (original repo)
1. A script should just be a bunch of functions, and then a main function doing nothing more than orchestrating them.
Keep the code modular.
2. Keep functions small. Seriously. Especially ones that write to the drive.
3. Do not EVER require root/admin. This code isn't well-tested enough to handle that power.
4. For super complex functions, write tests. If you can't, ask another contributor to help you.
5. If you're a collaborator, do not push to stable. I should be the only one doing that, so that the code can be reviewed and tested.
6. Contributors maintain copyright over their contributions, but agree to license it under GPL-3, with the rest of the code.
7. Do not make another assembler.py. Please. For the love of god, don't write crappy code like that ever again.

FarFetched Lessons (one containing lessons)
1. Do not commit garbage. Please, make sure you're making quality content. Let's not misinform people on what a litote is.
2. AI generated content is not quality content.
3. Don't commit anything that would violate someone's intellectual property rights.
4. If you believe that someone has posted a violation of your copyright on this repo, please contact admin@o8.lol or @sl8:matrix.org on the matrix federation.
